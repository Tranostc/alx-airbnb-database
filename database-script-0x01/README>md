## Objective
To normalize the AirBnB database schema to ensure it is in the Third Normal Form (3NF) to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Normalization Steps

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- **Criteria**: All attributes must contain atomic values, each column must have unique names, and the order of data storage does not matter.
- **Review**: The schema is in 1NF as all attributes are atomic and contain single values.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- **Criteria**: The schema must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- **Review**: The schema is in 2NF as all non-key attributes depend on their respective primary keys.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- **Criteria**: The schema must be in 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependencies.
- **Review**: The schema is in 3NF as all attributes depend solely on their primary keys, with no transitive dependencies.

## Conclusion
The AirBnB database schema is already in Third Normal Form (3NF). No additional changes were necessary, as all tables are structured to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity.
